    <h1>Soup</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Creamy Tomato Soup is easy, comforting, and has a rich flavor profile.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter – use unsalted butter to sautee onions</li>
        <li>Yellow onion – it seems like a ton of onion but it dissapears into the soup adding a balanced sweetness</li>
        <li>Garlic – you’ll need 1 Tbsp minced from about 3 cloves</li>
        <li>Crushed tomatoes – with their juice, preferably San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        <li>Chicken stock – for the best flavor use homemade chicken broth</li>
        <li>Basil – chop and add 1/4 cup fresh basil, plus more to serve. Basil leaves are easily bruised so chop by stacking a bunch of leaves then roll them into a log and cut into thin strips.</li>
        <li>Sugar – It’s just 1 Tbsp, but necessary to combat the tomato acidity.</li>
        <li>Black pepper – start with 1/2 tsp and add more to taste</li>
        <li>Whipping cream – adds a creaminess to the soup and offsets acidity.</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese – adds saltiness to the soup and balances acidity. Adding parmesan adds enough salt and I usually don’t add more.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Saute Aromatics – heat a non-reactive pot over medium heat. Melt in 4 Tbsp butter then sautee onions until softened and golden (10-12 min). Add minced garlic and saute another minute.</li>
        <li>Make the tomato soup base – stir in two 28 oz cans of crushed tomatoes with their juice, your chicken stock, chopped basil, sugar and black pepper. Bring to a boil then reduce heat, partially cover and simmer 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Blend if desired – use an immersion blender in the pot or blend in batches using a blender (be careful not to overfill the blender with hot liquid) and return soup to the pot.</li>
        <li>Add cream and parmesan – stir in the heavy cream and shredded parmesan. Return to a simmer and season to taste if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve – ladle into warm bowls and garnish with more parmesan and basil.</li>
    </ol>
